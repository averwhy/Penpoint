A lightweight yet robust event point tracking system, built around college clubs.

Penpoint is built with the Nuxt web framework, based off of Vue.js. It also utilizies TRPC for typesafe communication between the server and client.

> [!NOTE]
> Penpoint is under active development! It's expected to be mostly complete by the end of 2025.

## Setup
Penpoint was made with ease of setup in mind. Nuxt, the framework used for this site, combines the website and backend, so you'll only have to setup this website..

> [!CAUTION]
> The setup guide is a work in progress, as is Penpoint.
