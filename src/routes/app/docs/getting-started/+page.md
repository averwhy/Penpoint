# Getting started
If this is your first time using the Penmen Pride site, welcome! The SGA is looking forward to working with you to drive engagement on campus. This web application was designed with the clubs of SNHU in mind.

This guide contains an overview of what Penmen Pride is, how to navigate the site, and what features you can utilize.

## What's Penmen Pride?
The Penmen Pride program is an initiative created by the Student Government Association that has SNHU students enthusiastic about participating in events and programs around campus. This program enhances school spirit within our student body by implementing incentives for students to attend events. By having your event be a Penmen Pride event, you can look forward to students showing up excited to attend. Penmen Pride is just one of the ways that the Student Government Association builds student community spirit by creating a common goal among all SNHU students - to attend events, earn points, and win prizes.

## Club E-Board Users
As an E-Board member of a club on campus, you have access to a few features within the Penmen Pride website.

**Quick note:** if you happen to navigate to a page that you may not have access to, you'll be redirected to the [dashboard](/app).

#### Events
To request Penmen Pride at your event, head to the [events page](/app/events) and click **'Create New'**.
Next, enter all your event details.
Some things to note:
- For multi day events, create one entry per day.

After creating, your event will be pending approval from the SGA. One approved, it will become visible on the publically avaliable [events list](/events).

##### Editing events
You can edit event details if you need to change the name, flyer, etc.

You **cant**, however, edit the date or time of the event. If you need to change those details, **cancel the event**, and recreate it.
