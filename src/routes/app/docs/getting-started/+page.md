# Getting started
If this is your first time using the Penmen Pride site, welcome! The SGA is looking forward to working with you to drive engagement on campus. This web application was designed with the clubs of SNHU in mind.

This guide contains an overview of what Penmen Pride is, how to navigate the site, and what features you can utilize.

## What's Penmen Pride?
The Penmen Pride program is an initiative created by the Student Government Association that has SNHU students enthusiastic about participating in events and programs around campus. This program enhances school spirit within our student body by implementing incentives for students to attend events. The way it works is clubs/organizations/offices request Penmen Pride to be at an event (by creating an event on this website), then during the event, SGA Senators come and have students swipe their student ID's to earn a certain amount of points. At the end of the semester, the points are tallied, and the students with the most points earn prizes.

By having your event be a Penmen Pride event, you can look forward to students showing up excited to attend. Penmen Pride is just one of the ways that the Student Government Association builds student community spirit by creating a common goal among all SNHU students - to attend events, earn points, and win prizes.

## Club E-Board Users
*This is most users, including if you're part of an office on campus, e.g. the Chandler Center.*

**Quick note:** if you happen to navigate to a page that you may not have access to, you'll be redirected to the [dashboard](/app).

### Your Club
Chances are, you're apart of at least one club (you specified this when requesting an account). If you're apart of multiple clubs (or organizations), you can a apart of them on Penmen Pride too! Just [reach out to us here](/app/help).

Remember you can also view what clubs or organizations on the [club list page](/app/club).

### Events
To request Penmen Pride at your event, head to the [events page](/app/events) and click **'Create New'**.
Next, enter all your event details.
Some things to note:
- For multi day events, create one entry per day.
- You can't create events for past semesters (obviously)
- You *can* make events for future semesters (if they're visible in the dropdown), but they won't show up in the [events list](/events) until the active semester ends.

After creating, your event will be pending, as it's awaiting approval from the SGA. 
One approved, it will become visible on the publically avaliable [events list](/events).

### Editing events
You can edit event details if you need to change the name, flyer, etc.
You **cant**, however, edit the date or time of the event. If you need to change those details, **cancel the event**, and recreate it.

To edit an event, find your event in the ['backend' events list](/app/events) (this is a list of all events for the semester, including unapproved ones.) Once you find it, click the title of it to view it, or the 3 dots at the end of the row -> 'View Event'. From there, you can click **Edit Event** to edit certain details.

## SGA Users
An a member of SGA, you have access to all the features that [Club E-Board users](http://localhost:5173/app/docs/getting-started#club-e-board-users) have, as well as some others. You're most likely a senator that will be scanning for events. As such, the most important page is [event scanning](/app/scan). 

### Scanning for events
When you go to an event to scan, you'll need an SGA IPad with a keycard swiper, and to be in SGA attire. Depending on the size of the event, you'll go with other senators, and potentially even bring some promotional material for Penmen Pride. On the iPad, [login](/login) to the site, then navigate to the [event scanning](/app/scan) page. In the event dropdown, select the event you're scanning for, and youre good to get started.

#### Approving or denying events
SGA should be reviewing event requests daily. When you go to [approve or deny events on the event requests page](/app/requests/events), it will look similar to the other backend events list, but this one has the functionality to approve/deny events. The simplest way to do it is to click the 3 dots on a row for an event, and then click **Quick approve** or **Quick deny**.
Upon approval, the event will be added to the [events list](/events). The E-Board members apart of that club will also recieve an email of the 

**Approving an event signifies SGA's commitment to show up at the event and scan for Penmen Pride points.**

#### Approving or denying new users
SGA should (also) be reviewing new user requests daily. New users should be either a E-Board member of an active club on campus, or an employee of an office on campus (student or otherwise).
Accepting (or denying) will send an email to that user notifying them of the descision. If they're approved, that email will include a link to setup their account (password, etc).
