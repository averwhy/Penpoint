# Troubleshooting

## For users

If you're encountering something unexpected with the site, chances are something is off on the clientside (that would be you). Try again after refreshing, after you've logged out then back in, or if that doesn't solve it, a different browser.

In the event something is wrong on the website's end (uncommon, but it happens), you should note the error message and steps to reproduce the issue, and let us know [via the help form](/app/help).

## For admins

Before you dive deep into troubleshooting, ensure the database is running (see [setup documentation](/app/docs/admins/setup)).
