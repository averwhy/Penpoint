# Admins
As an admin, you have access to all the features that a [club E-Board](/app/docs/basic-usage/club-users) user has, as well as an [SGA](/app/docs/basic-usage/sga) user. 

This guide will detail how to manage semesters (which is really important), manage/delete events, manage clubs, and more.

## Semester management (creating and deleting)
This is a pretty important part of running Penmen Pride. In order for club E-Board members to create events, there needs to be an active or upcoming semester.

To create a semester, head to the [semesters management page](/app/manage/semesters) and click 'Create New Semester'. You'll see a 'code' selection (either A1 for spring, A3 for fall), a start date and an end date. The start and end dates should be the first and last day of classes for the undergraduate on-campus term, respectively. After creating the semester, it will be avaliable for events to be made under it.

I dont know why you would want to (unless you somehow made a semester on accident, or put in the incorrect dates), but if you need to delete a semester, you first have to ensure that there are no events (either upcoming or past), then you are able to delete the semester from the individual semester view page (you can get to it from [semester management](/app/manage/semesters) -> 3 dots -> view semester).

## User management
The [user management page](/app/manage/users) shows *approved* users (if you're looking for new user requests, remember they're [here](/app/requests/users)). Here, you can view user information, change their roles (e.g. from SGA to Admin), send password resets, and delete users. It also shows their account creation date which is helpful in keeping track of old users.

## Club Management
(WIP)

## Event Management
This [page](/app/manage/events) is really similar to the 'backend' events viewer that everyone else can see. The key difference here is that you can modify existing events here. Unlike [regular event editing](/app/docs/getting-started#editing-events), you can change the date and time of events, if necessary. You can also change the point value of the event from this page.

### Changing the point value of an event
It should be noted that when you change the point value of an event, it changes the value of every past scan-in for that event. For example, if Jay scanned into Big Money Bingo while it was worth 3 points, he would have 3 points total. Then, if Mandy (an admin) went and editing the point value of that event to 4 points, Jay would then have 4 points.
