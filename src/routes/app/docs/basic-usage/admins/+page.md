# Admins
As an admin, you have access to all the features that a [club E-Board](/app/docs/basic-usage/club-users) user has, as well as an [SGA](/app/docs/basic-usage/sga) user. 

This guide will detail how to manage semesters (which is really important), manage/delete events, manage clubs, and more.

## Semesters
This is a pretty important part of running Penmen Pride. In order for club E-Board members to create events, there needs to be an active or upcoming semester.

To create a semester, head to the [semesters management page](/app/manage/semesters) and click 'Create New Semester'.
