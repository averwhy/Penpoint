# Club E-Board member
As an E-Board member of a club on campus, you have access to a few features within the Penmen Pride website.

**Quick note:** if you happen to navigate to a page that you may not have access to, you'll be redirected to the [dashboard](/app).

## Events
To request Penmen Pride at your event, head to the [events page](/app/events) and click **'Create New'**.
Next, enter all your event details.
Some things to note:
- For multi day events, create one entry per day.

After creating, your event will be pending approval from the SGA. One approved, it will become visible on the publically avaliable [events list](/events).

### Editing events
You can edit event details if you need to change the name, flyer, etc.

You **cant**, however, edit the date or time of the event. If you need to change those details, **cancel the event**, and recreate it.
