                The Penmen Pride program created by the SNHU Student Government Organization (SGA) to create enthusiasm about participating in events and programs around campus. This program enhances school spirit within our student body by implementing incentives for students to attend events. By having Penmen Pride at your event, you can look forward to students showing up and being excited to attend.<br/><br/>Penmen Pride is just one of the ways that the (SGA) builds student community spirit by creating a common goal among all SNHU students - to earn points, and win prizes!
